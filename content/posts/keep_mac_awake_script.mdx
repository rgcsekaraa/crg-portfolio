Hello everyone! 👋 I wanted to share a quick fix for a problem I recently faced.

I was transferring about half a terabyte of files from my Mac to an external
SSD, and I needed my Mac to stay awake until it was done. First, I tried using
the built-in `caffeinate` command in Terminal, but it didn’t work as expected.
Then, I installed the Amphetamine app for macOS—still no luck 🥲. So, I ended up
writing a little Python script to keep my Mac awake for as long as I needed!

We’ll be using the `pyautogui` Python module to do this. It simulates a key
press at regular intervals to prevent your Mac from going to sleep.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed, then install `pyautogui` using:

```bash
pip install pyautogui
```

## Script

Here’s the Python code:

```python
import pyautogui
import time

# Interval (in seconds) between each simulated keypress
interval = 60

try:
    print("Press Ctrl+C to stop the script.")
    while True:
        pyautogui.press('shift')  # Simulate pressing the Shift key
        print("Shift key pressed to prevent sleep.")
        time.sleep(interval)      # Wait for the specified interval
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Script stopped.")
```

Save the above code as `run.py` and in Terminal, run:

```bash
python3 run.py
```

The script will press the Shift key every minute (or whatever interval you set).
This action is enough to keep your Mac awake until you’re ready to quit.

To stop the script, simply press `Ctrl + C`.

## How This Works

The repeated key press tricks macOS into thinking you’re still active, so it
won’t enter sleep mode. While this isn’t the only way to keep a Mac awake, it’s
a straightforward solution that doesn’t require downloading any extra apps.

## A Few Notes

- This might not be the “best” solution, and if you’re running macOS 18 or
  later, there may be built-in options I haven’t explored yet.

Hope this helps someone out there! Thanks for reading, and peace ✌️❤️
